# Florida Department of Corrections: Contraband Seizures (2018-2020)

By: Shirsho Dasgupta (2022)

The code cleans up the datasets for contraband seizures and monthly inmate populations — for Florida, California and Texas' prison systems — and calculates the rates per 10,000 inmates of seized forbidden items. 

The data was used in the story "[How a ban on visitors impacted the smuggling of drugs into Florida prisons](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/florida-prisons/article264165166.html)"

#### Note: 
1. A "contraband incident" refers to one where a forbidden item has been found. A single incident can refer to a search in which multiple forbidden items have been found. 

2. A state-by-state comparison was not computed because there are/may be differences between how the data is recorded in each state and exactly what items are forbidden. Moreover, Texas does not separately record the amounts and types of contraband found in each incident.
